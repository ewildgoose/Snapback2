Snapback2 version 0.01
======================

The snapback2 script is an enhancement of Art Mulder's original
snapback script based on Mike Rubel's research into using rsync
as a backup method. It greatly revamps configuration, and has the 
following features:

	* Makes rsync snapshot backups on an hourly, daily, monthly,
	  and yearly basis.
	* Can be repeatedly called and if AutoTime is set, it will only
	  make backups when the proper amount of time has passed.
	* Allows multiple backup destinations to split the backup
	  over multiple disks for reliablility.
	* 

There is documentation embedded in the script file
README file from a module distribution so that people browsing the
archive can use it get an idea of the modules uses. It is usually a
good idea to provide version information here so that people can
decide whether fixes for the module are worth downloading.

INSTALLATION

To install snapback2 type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This script requires these other modules and libraries:

  Config::ApacheFormat

Because it is based on rsync, it requires that program. It was
developed on rsync-2.5.7 and should work with that and all
subsequent versions. It may work with previous versions, but that
has not been tested.

It also requires GNU "cp", "mv", and "rm". Other versions may not work
due to use of GNU-specific options, particularly in "cp".

SUPPORT

This script is offered without support. The author has been known to
answer questions, but no hand-holding will be done -- for example, if
your message has a subject of "HELP!!!" it is automatically deleted. If
you don't get an answer it is probably because the question was not good
enough or is answered in the supplied documentation.

questions about this policy.
